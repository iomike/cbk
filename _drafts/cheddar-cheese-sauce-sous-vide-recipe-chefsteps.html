A novice might think that fondue is nothing more than grated cheese stirred into hot wine, but that is a recipe for a fondue gone wrong. More often than not the simmering wine ends up greasy while the gooey mess of cheese proteins settle to the bottom of the pot, where they promptly scorch. Whether preparing a thick, flavorful fondue or a smooth, flowing cheese sauce like our cheddar cheese sauce, experienced fondue makers know that it’s important to blend mature cheese with a smaller amount of youthful cheese. A blend of older and younger cheeses balances an appealing flavor with a pleasant texture. But the secret ingredient has always been a very dry, overly tart, and slightly fruity wine. Such a wine concentrates various fruit acids like tartaric, malic, and citric acid. And the salts of these acids—especially sodium citrate—are very effective at binding calcium in the cheese. This helps loosen bonds between the mesh of casein proteins, which in turn helps keep the entire mix of oil, water, and proteins emulsified.No one knows how far back this kitchen wisdom goes, but in 1912 two Swiss food scientists were working on the problem of sterilizing cheese so that it could be stored, unrefrigerated, in hot climates. Up until this point, the results had been greasy failures; but these scientists discovered that adding the salt of citric acid (sodium citrate) to the cheese could prevent oiling-off. They had invented processed cheese. Independently, a few years later, an American did much the same thing with another salt, sodium hexametaphosphate. This discovery became the cornerstone of his namesake business: Kraft. Salts such as sodium citrate and sodium hexametaphosphate are known in the cheese industry as melting salts and replace the need for using a overly dry and tart wine. Their primary purpose is to swap sodium ions for calcium ions bound to the casein proteins in cheese. In doing so, they loosen these proteins and make them water-soluble.In combination with heating and stirring, these melting salts improve the emulsifying ability of the proteins in the cheese. They also tend to shift the pH of the cheese upward, which improves the texture and stability of molten cheese. Overly acidic melted cheese is unstable, and has an unpleasant texture. Experienced cheese processors target a pH between 5.2 and 6.3 for the best results.</p></blockquote>
