You watch Ina Garten make a corn salad, and you think: **"Hey, I can do that."** And yes, it turns out, you can. As you keep cooking, the recipes get more and more complicated, and one day you find you're tweaking things here and there—making dishes on your own without consulting the internet for permission. You know to use cumin when you're out of coriander. You serve spinach and walnut pesto instead of that one you made with basil and pine nuts five million times. Once you get to a certain level of cooking, recipes begin to function more as inspiration than straight-up instruction. They give you ideas you can play off of, because **you have acquired intuition about flavor combinations**, and that intuition frees you up to be creative. But what's essential to this creative process is technique, and technique can only be mastered through practice. Here, we offer a technique for turning any hard vegetable into sweet, buttery, fork-tender treats that pair perfectly with most any protein. It's not hard to master, and will likely evolve into your go-to no-brainer way to transform your CSA contents into delicious side dishes—no recipe required.</p></blockquote>
