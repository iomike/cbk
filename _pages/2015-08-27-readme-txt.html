<p>I'm based in beautiful Chattanooga, Tennessee and some of my life-long Southerness will come out in what I talk about.</p>
<p>This site is just a private little corner of the web where I file recipes, restaurants I like, recipes I wanna try, and various links to foodie shit around the web.</p>
<p>We don't sous vide and we don't do molecular gastronomy, if that's your thing that's fine. I like and make simple food.</p>
<p><strong>Four rules for how I write on the site.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><del>It's going to</del> Be simple.</li>
<li>Be friendly.</li>
<li>Be real.</li>
<li>Be positive.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Guidelines</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Talk up, not down. It's just food. (see rule #2)</li>
<li>A photo (when possible).</li>
<li>You will see the kitchen, mess and all.(see rule #3)</li>
<li>I will not make up new words (E-V-O-O? WTF?) (see rules #1 &amp; 3)</li>
<li>Sponsored posts will be marked as such. (see rule #3)</li>
<li>No politics or religion, unless it relates to food. (see rule #2)</li>
<li>Bad restaurants, vendors, or producers will not be mentioned. (rule #2)</li>
</ol>
